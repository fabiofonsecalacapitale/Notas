Course in Udacity: Linux command line basics
https://www.udacity.com/course/linux-command-line-basics--ud595

In VirtualBox, share folder is in: media/sf_(name shared folder)

see:  file /etc/hosts      it sets up a local DNS

-------------------------essential command line commands------------------------------------

cd (goes back to the home path)
cd /somefolder  (absloute path)
cd somefolder (relative path)
use tab to autocomplete
use && to concatenate commands: echo hello && echo bye
ls
echo $PATH
On Windows: echo %JAVA_HOME%
Ctrl+C to finish the command line from running
ctrl+D or Ctrl+z depending on your operating system
pwd (print working directory)
man
hostname  (shows the computer name for itself)
host
ping 
cp
mkdir and rmdir
 

sudo apt-get and apt-update 
sudo apt install nodejs=[version]  
apt-get remove eclipse     (uninstall eclipse)
apt remove nodejs npm      (uninstall node and npm)
lsb_release -a             (linux standard base. provides distribution info, such as your linux version)

more
piping and redirecting (see page 40 of Algorithms book, 4th edition)
#Creates a shortcut on Linux
ln -s ~/Postman ~/Desktop (tilde means the home directory)
ps aux     (lists the processes running  (think this came from the Docker course))
whereis java (needs to be executable files)
which
sudo chmod -R 777 *    (Kateryna did this one to give full access to everyone in the config folder. Sorta dangerous) 



---------------------------Course Notes-----------------------------------------


-Module 1: set up with Virtual Box and Vagrant
Vagrant file:
single quote needs to be matched with another single quote in the command line
vagrant up (starts the virtual machine) and then
vagrant ssh : to login in the linux virtual machine
exit or ctrl+D : to logout
Ctrl+C: interrupts the program 
curl is a command for downloading files from the web (kinda)

- Difference between terminal and Shell(Gnu bash for instance)
- Mentions shell scripting, but we wont go into it in the course

/*********************************************************************/

host udacity.com : looks up a name in the DNS (see 1.10 lesson)
hostname : the computer own name for itself
expr 2+2
history
uname: operating system I am running on
cat : concatenate
wc: word count
diff: diff between 2 files
man : manual of the command
ls -l : long list. gives details such as modification time, file size etc

ls -a or ls --all: prints all files - the shell usually hides files that start with a dot (interesting)
if it starts with a dash it is a file. If it starts with a d, it is directory
cp: create copy
rm -rf / : VERY DANGEROUS!!! Recursevely deletes without prompting for confirmation

2.10: Ctrl+D to indicate the last line (input has ended OR end of file character) - Remember Subset.java in AlgorithmsI Princeton second Assignment
sort : called a line based program
ping : command to ping a server. Ctrl+C: interrupt the program (see 2.10)
the touch command (not in the course)
pwd command
unzip command
echo command
mkdir and rmdir commands

^ means the ctrl key
nano : command to edit text 

3.2-) Linux have files and directories (folders)
      Unlike Windows, there is only one root directory (no drivers such as C and D). In other words, the aren't separate roots for each disc partition
      Linux uses forward slash instead of backslash as Windows does
      your files can have spaces and special characters such as !. However, make sure you either escape them with a backslash or single quote the file name 
3.4-) relative paths do not start with a slash 
      ~ refers to your home directory
3.6-) cd with no arguments takes you back to your home directory
3.10-) mv and cp commands to move and copy files in linux. Create a file is: creat
3.14-) Glob pattern in linux. Seems about the same thing as a REGEX
